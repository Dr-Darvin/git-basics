# initial push request
 # before this first add the remote origin by
    git remote add  origin <remote repo https / ssh link>

# to push for specific branch
# first update the remote with local
    git pull origin

# add the changes
    git add

# commit untrack files 
    git commit -m "message"

# then push
    git push origin <Branch_name> # here origin means the remote repo location

# or we can push to another remote branch from sitting on other local branches
    git push origin <local_branh>:<remote_branch>

** do not recommand **
to push the code to repo forcefully 
  git push origin master --force
